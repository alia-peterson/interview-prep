# Flashcards for Interview Preparations

This project was created to help Mod4 (and sooner) students at Turing School prepare themselves for the interview process. The questions on each flashcard were taken from [this](https://mod4.turing.io/lessons/technical-interview-questions.html) Turing resource. 

## Using this Application

Anyone who would like to view the flashcards can visit this [page](https://interview-prep-turing.vercel.app/).  

Once on the website, a user can select which program they are in (FE/BE) at the top right of the page and will only be shown flashcards from that program. 

Each flashcard has a button for `Add Answer` so that the user can add notes or other resources for each question. These notes will be saved in your browser's `localStorage` so that they can be referenced at a later time. Note: the `localStorage` will only save answers for your currently selected program. If the user toggles between programs, the saved answers will be lost/overwritten. This is a feature that I may add in the future if it seems necessary. 

## Contributions

I would love feedback for making this tool more usable in the future. To install a local version of this project, do the following: 

`git clone git@github.com:alia-peterson/interview-prep.git` 

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm i` and `npm start`

Which will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Once you've made changes on a local branch, please feel free to create a Pull Request and I will review the changes before they're merged! 

### Deployment

This application is currently deployed [here](https://interview-prep-turing.vercel.app/).
